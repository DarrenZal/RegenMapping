Salish Sea Cooperative Finance (SSCoFi) is a cooperatively-owned social enterprise helping members align their money with their values through investing, borrowing, and financial literacy.

We’re happy to provide assistance and technical support to people who are interested in starting their own, similar programs.

View our [guidebook](https://salishseafinance.coop/guidebook/), a living document about how to build a co-operative that can issue credit to its members and in doing so, grow our collective power, and our ability to self determine and make choices in the best interest of community health and wellbeing. 

## Real Rent Duwamish

What is Real Rent?​ Real Rent calls on people who live and work in Seattle to make rent payments to the Duwamish Tribe. Though the city named for the Duwamish leader Chief Seattle thrives - the Tribe has yet to be justly compensated for their land, resources, and livelihood. 

You can do something today to stand in solidarity with First Peoples of this land by paying Real Rent. 

All funds go directly to [Duwamish Tribal Services](https://www.duwamishtribe.org/) (DTS) to support the revival of Duwamish culture and the vitality of the Duwamish Tribe.

## West Seattle Time Bank

We connect residents of West Seattle, White Center, and Burien by providing a way to offer and ask for help, exchanging time credits instead of money. Whether you spend an hour with a computer or a shovel, it counts as an hour.

- BUILD: Find out what your friends and neighbors like to do or want support doing. It doesn’t have to be a formal timebank. 
    

- Give time: You don’t have to be an expert to provide time to someone, just be willing to try and learn (not encouraged for brain surgery). 
    
- Receive time: Asking for help feels vulnerable, but opens you up to closer connections.
    
- If you want to find out more about formal timebanking, email us at [westseattletimebank@gmail.com](mailto:westseattletimebank@gmail.com).

We are a small community (4-6 full time people) stewarding the land by growing organic food, raising animals on pasture, and learning and practicing social forestry. 

Poetically: We invoke intention through time and patterns that rhyme to bring the bounty of the beautiful world we all know is possible. We let go of what no longer serves us. We welcome enthusiasm of all kinds to emblazon its wild fire in the hearts of all those who have wood to burn. We drink water from a spring, fresh from the ground with gratitude. We sweat offerings in the sauna and cold plunge our bodies that we may temper our being. We would love to meet you and share with you this beautiful land!

# FOOD SYSTEMS/LAND USE

## The Heron’s Nest

Restorative justice landback project with respect to the DuwamishTribe. This project is the first ever rematriation attempt with respect to the Duwamish Tribe and would have significant impacts on the Tribe’s recognition claims. Now that the property has been cleaned up and new facilities have been created, there is ample space for meaningful community programming, education, social events, traditional practices, gardening/farming, and more.

- [Monday volunteer days](https://www.instagram.com/p/DIZrTKfhvd1/?igsh=eGx6dWNkdzczN3Rp) [10a-2pm] Weekly our volunteers gather to focus efforts on healing the soil, upskilling in indigenous ways of tending to the earth, healing from separation of the natural world and food sovereignty for the first peoples.
    
-  [Climate Cafe's](https://www.duwamishtribe.org/ticketedevents/climate-circle-at-herons-nest): Every third Sunday in the summer, from 11am–3pm, we gather at Heron’s Nest — a once-wounded 3.5-acre stretch of land now on the path to being rematriated to the Duwamish people — for a Climate Circle: a space to slow down, feel deeply, and be held in community and nurture communal mental health & wellbeing. The circle starts at 11:00 am, and lasts about an hour and a half. If you like, you can stay and we'll make art together until around 3:00 pm.
    

Climate Circles are spaces to name where one’s mental health is and what aches — grief, rage, fear, numbness, even fleeting hope — and to let those feelings breathe in the company of others. Rooted in deep listening and collective care, this practice reminds us we are not alone, and that feeling fully is part of learning to relate differently.

## River Access Paddle Program 

[The River Access Paddle Program](https://www.riveraccesspaddleprogram.org/events) (RAPP!) is working towards a long-term community goal to promote the Duwamish River as a safe and accessible place to get exercise, build community connections, and share information about the history and environment of Seattle’s only river. We are working with Duwamish River communities to create more access and awareness opportunities on The Duwamish River and the Salish Sea. Through a 2025 Duwamish River Opportunity Fund grant we are able to offer free programs to the public, encouraging health and education around the Duwamish River. Various trips, season ends in October, launch times are dependent on the tides.

# MUTUAL AID/COMMUNITY SELF-GOVERNANCE

## Dual Power Network

The Dual Power Network (DPN) is a collective of organizers dedicated to building the kind of sustainable, long-term relationships and practical knowledge base we need to build a more liberated, community self-determined society in the shell of the one crumbling around us.

We focus on making connections between organizers doing similar work across regions, plugging new organizers into existing dual power projects, co-creating knowledge with our network members, creating shareable resources, and spreading the [spores](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002307.htm) of [dual power as an organizing strategy](https://www.blackrosefed.org/retreat-advance-dual-power/).

## SuperFamilia

Super Familia (instagram:[https://www.instagram.com/superfamilia_kc](https://www.instagram.com/superfamilia_kc))  is a grassroots group led by undocumented unaccompanied indigenous youth. Our mission is to organize and build collective power through a network of mutual aid, healing, skill-building/sharing, and relationship building in response to systems of oppression. As survivors of complex trauma, our long-term objectives are: (1) to end systems of oppression through organizing, protesting, workshops, and political education (2); heal through art and reconnecting with our roots; (3) create sustainable ways of building collective power through spaces that allow undocumented/formerly incarcerated youth to be be paid for their labor; and (4) expose the US’ continuous violent history of family separation and incarceration. So far we have organized protests against detention centers and ICE; led ceremonies with indigenous healers; collaborated to distribute monthly organic produce to indigenous and migrant communities; celebrated cultural events; co-created healing sessions based on harm-reduction and justice; and created art/healing workshops.

o  Tell Our Elected Officials: Stand Up and Say NO to a Non-Citizen Registry!

Shortly after taking office, Donald Trump issued an order requiring all non-citizens living in the United States to register with the government, which was just upheld by a federal judge on Thursday, April 10th. Similar orders were cited as the basis for mass internment of Japanese immigrants during World War 2, and the mass persecution of Arabs and Muslims after the 9/11 attacks. There is no doubt, given his extreme anti-immigrant rhetoric, that Donald Trump's administration plans to follow a similarly destructive and shameful path with this order.

This is only one example in a series of targeted actions in recent weeks against immigrant communities. We will not sit by and let history repeat itself! Write to our city councilors, governors, and representatives in Congress to remind them that the PEOPLE want them to STAND UP and say NO to a registry of non-citizens, and to use their power to defend the rights of immigrants!   Link to letter campaign:  [http://bit.ly/4czy93A](http://bit.ly/4czy93A)
