# Regen Mapping Project

A comprehensive knowledge graph and visualization platform for mapping regenerative organizations, people, and relationships across the globe.

## üå± Project Vision

The Regen Mapping project aims to create an interactive 3D globe and force-directed network graph that visualizes the regenerative economy ecosystem. By mapping organizations, individuals, and their relationships, we're building a living directory that helps:

- **Discover** regenerative organizations and changemakers
- **Connect** complementary projects and people
- **Visualize** the network topology of the regenerative movement
- **Track** the growth and evolution of regenerative initiatives
- **Facilitate** collaboration and resource sharing

## üéØ Key Features

### Dual Visualization Modes
- **3D Globe View**: Geographic positioning showing real-world distribution of regenerative initiatives
- **Force-Directed Graph**: Relationship-focused network visualization revealing connections and influence patterns

### Rich Data Integration
- **Multi-Schema Support**: Unified approach combining Schema.org standards, Murmurations discovery features, and custom regenerative categorization
- **Comprehensive Profiles**: Organizations and individuals with detailed metadata, impact metrics, and relationship mapping
- **Live Matching**: AI-powered suggestions connecting complementary needs and offers

### Interactive Discovery
- **Smart Filtering**: By domain, method, geographic scope, activity level, and relationship type
- **Temporal Views**: Timeline slider showing network evolution over time
- **Cluster Analysis**: Automatic detection of communities and influence hubs

## üìö Documentation

### Core Documentation
- **[Project Specifications](docs/project-specifications.md)** - Detailed technical specifications, UI mockups, and implementation guidelines
- **[Seed Organizations](docs/seed-organizations.md)** - Initial dataset from Cascadia Bioregional Financing Conference

### Schema Documentation
- **[Schema Comparison](docs/schemas/unified-organization-schema-comparison.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of Schema.org, Murmurations, and Dylan Tull's approaches
- **[Schema Mapping Guide](docs/schemas/schema-mapping-guide.md)** - Transformation rules and conversion utilities between different schema formats

## üèóÔ∏è Work Completed

### Phase 1: Schema Research & Development ‚úÖ
- **Downloaded and extracted Schema.org Organization schemas** from the official JSON-LD source
- **Analyzed three major schema approaches**:
  - Schema.org (web standards compliance)
  - Murmurations (regenerative economy discovery)
  - Dylan Tull's schema (rich categorization for mapping/visualization)
- **Created unified schema proposal** combining the best elements of all three approaches
- **Built complete Murmurations schema** with all field definitions expanded inline (no external references)
- **Developed transformation guides** for converting between schema formats

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning ‚úÖ
- **Comprehensive data model** with Person and Organization node types
- **Relationship taxonomy** covering collaboration, funding, mentorship, and governance connections
- **Visual encoding specifications** for both globe and graph representations
